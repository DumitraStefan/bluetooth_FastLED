# Intro

This is a project based on an Arduino board that reads data from a bluetooth module to light up an LED strip twisted like a seven segment 

### Hardware

1. Arduino Uno
2. HC-05 bluetooth module
3. individually adresable RGB LED strip (WS2811 driver)
4. 1000 Î¼F capacitor
5. 300 ohm resistor
6. 12 V power suply
7. jumper wires
